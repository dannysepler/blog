## Introduction

CSV Kit is a powerful command line tool that can help make sense of CSV documents easily and quickly! I don't think I can do a better overview to it than the [official tutorial](https://csvkit.readthedocs.io/en/1.0.3/tutorial/1_getting_started.html), which even guides you through a real-world example.

Once you're finished with that, come back here for some of my favorite tricks.
