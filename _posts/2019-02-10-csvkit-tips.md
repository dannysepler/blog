## Introduction

[CSV Kit](https://csvkit.readthedocs.io/en/1.0.3/) is a powerful command line tool that can help make sense of CSV documents easily and quickly!

_Why do I care about this?_

If you use data of any sort, CSV Kit can be a painless way to make sense of it. You can use CSV Kit organize, transform, and search for something you want in either Excel or CSV format.

_Why not just use Excel?_

Excel is bulky, and often has too many features for a small answerable question. This is especially a problem as a file gets larger and larger. As well, sometimes your question is very simple, and doesn't need a lot to it. CSV Kit cuts through the weeds!

_Why not just use a Python script?_

Sometimes if you have a simple question, a script can be overkill. Finding what you need may not require writing new code, debugging, and making sure it works. Sometimes it can be as easy as a simple command line statement with CSV Kit.

## Getting Started

I don't think I can do a better overview to it than the [official tutorial](https://csvkit.readthedocs.io/en/1.0.3/tutorial/1_getting_started.html), which even guides you through a real-world example.

Once you're finished with that, come back here for some of my favorite tricks.
