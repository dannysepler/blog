I was going through some old photos recently, and found that my disposable camera captured these moments so well! Most of these are from hiking trips of some sort -- but doesn't the haziness of a film photo just make a landscape come alive?

## Mount Chocorua (NH)

This was from a trip where a group and I climbed to the top of a mountain, and to our dismay there was nothing but fog in every direction. We had spent the past day and a half on the trail on the way up, and had no view to show for it. There was another day and a half to go back down, and it seemed that at the moment that it was all for nothing.

We had lunch at the top of the summit. As we were about to reluctantly head down, a tiny patch of blue appeared overhead. Soon after, the entire cloud blocking our view passed on and we could see for miles. Funny enough, I forgot to snap a picture after the cloud passed; yet, I can't help but think now that this photo in the clouds is more notable than a photo of the view could ever had been.

## Neel's Gap / Blood Mountain (GA)

I don't have as much of a story for these two, but this is at around the start of the Appalachian Trail in Georgia. I can only imagine for someone brave enough to go through the whole trail, how amazing it must be to start off with sunsets like this one.
