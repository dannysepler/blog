## Introduction

Ever since I started at Flatiron Health, I've been meaning to learn more about cancer. I'll be collecting reading materials here. Please reach out if there's something good left out of this particular list! I'll try to cover both meaningful and informational content, and subdivide where relevant.

# On the history

- **Emperor of all maladies** (novel), Siddhartha Mukherjee

   This book can serve as the start to a long learning journey about the disease. Informational yet personal, it focuses on the people and history of the disease, coloring these stories with clinical content. The book focuses on [Sidney Farber][sidney-farber] in particular as a hero of sorts -- a figure who made clinical advances, and pioneered important fundraising efforts. The book holds back few punches, as Mukherjee highlights meaningful advances and discredits approaches that did more harm than good (like once-fashionable radical surgeries).

   Noticeably missing from this book is content on immunotherapy, which was glazed over towards the last few chapters. (Mukherjee has another book called The Gene, which may cover more in that realm.)




# On mortality

- **Various reflections** (articles), by Oliver Sacks

   A favorite author of mine, Oliver Sacks is a neurologist who passed away from complications of an ocular tumor. There's lots of meaningful articles to pick from.

   - [My own life][my-own-life]: written soon after learning his cancer had metastasized, Sacks reflects on viewing his life from a high altitude.
   - [My periodic table][my-periodic-table]: parallelizing the later years of his life to their respective elements.
   - [Sabbath][sabbath]: On faith and on reconnections. Using the day of rest as the article's name was probably a careful decision, considering he passed a little over two weeks later.

- **When breath becomes air** (novel), by Paul Kalanithi

  Written by a former young neurosurgeon about to finish residency, Kalanithi investigates the transition from doctor to patient as he reconciles his Stage IV lung cancer. A shift in tone is visible throughout the novel. From impatient to accepting, from the vantage of a doctor to the vantage of an author, Kalanithi's change in character progresses with every page turn. One can't help but feel at the end whether the book was unfinished? The last chapter felt whispy, as if there still were more that he wanted to convey.
