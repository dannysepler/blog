I'm excited to give this a shot.

I can't promise I'll write very often or even regularly. But, when I come across an interesting topic or new technology, I will recount my thoughts and experiences here.

For the time being, you can read a tutorial I co-wrote last year about using the [Express Checkout API from Stripe's collaboration with American Express][express-checkout-article].

This was in collaboration with the University of Florida's Swamphacks event, a yearly hackathon I have attended twice -- once as an entrant and again as a sponsor. I would highly recommend it for both software novices and experts. If you need incentive to consider it, just look at how beautiful [last year's][2018-swamphacks] and [this year's][2019-swamphacks] websites are.

You can also see a (somewhat silly) [project with simple Markov Chains][markov-chain] I created here.
